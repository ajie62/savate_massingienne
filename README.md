# OC_P6 : Savate Massingienne
Hello! This repository holds the code for the sixth project of the Web Development - Project Manager 
training course on [Openclassrooms](http://www.openclassrooms.com).

## The Project
I've been asked by two athlete brothers to create a website with the aim of improving
their online visibility and attracting new members for their sports club.

## Development
The project is made using PHP, especially the framework Symfony4, and Twig (PHP Template Engine).
Concerning the styles, the CSS preprocessor SASS was, I think, the best choice.
